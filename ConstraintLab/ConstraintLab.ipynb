    "1. Form groups.   Go to Canvas and assign yourself to a group in the Group Set named ConstraintLab.  You can work alone if you want, and groups may have at most three members.\n",
    "1. We will be using the Python constraints library, so install it (URLs below)\n",
    "1. Read the documentation to get see some examples of the library in action\n",
